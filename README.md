## Important

After registering and logging in, `products can be added to your local database by navigating to the "Manage Products" page, clicking the "Add Product" button and entering all the required information.`  
All the images for the products are provided locally in the assets/imgs folder. In order to use one of these already provided images, `please input a6400.png, alienware17r4.png, iphone11.png, iphone12.png, or iphonex.png for the "Product Image" input.` Otherwise, you can use any image you want by simply adding it to the assets/imgs folder and inputting that image name instead.
