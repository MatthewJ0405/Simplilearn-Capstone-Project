## Important

After registering and logging in, `products can be added to your local database by navigating to the "Manage Products" page, clicking the "Add Product" button and entering all the required information.`
All the images for the products are provided locally in the assets/imgs folder. In order to use one of these already provided images, `please input a6400.png, alienware17r4.png, iphone11.png, iphone12.png, or iphonex.png for the "Product Image" input.` Otherwise, you can use any image you want by simply adding it to the assets/imgs folder and inputting that image name instead.

## Clarification on Admin Portal

Since we were told that we could create separate projects (ie web pages) for the Admin portal and Customer portal, I decided that rather than creating a separate web page for both the Admin portal and the Customer Portal, they are combined into one for quicker testing. That is why after logging in as a regular customer, the CRUD operations for companies, products, and users are able to be accessed.
